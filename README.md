# recursive-expression-building
Inserts operators ("+", "-", "") between operands to build expressions and evaluates the expressions against a target sum.
<p> For example: number = 1234, sum = 46 will evaluate to
<br>12+34=46
<p>Another example: number = 12345, sum = 0
<br>12-3-4-5=0
<br>-12+3+4+5=0
